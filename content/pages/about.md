I am currently working towards my PhD at Imperial College London. I'm a member of the **I**ntelligent **B**ehaviour **U**nderstanding **G**roup (IBUG), focusing on dense reconstruction of facial shape from images. In particular, I'm interested in investigating the low-rank relationship between images and shape.
