The majority of my work revolves around the area of recovering a dense 
representation of shape from 2D images. For example, given an image of face,
we aim to recover a 3D mesh that best approximates the face that created
the image.

I have also been working on parametric image alignment and visual deformable
models. If you are interested in this, I suggest you check out a project 
from my team called [Menpo](http://menpo.org). Menpo is a Python framework
for building fitting deformable models, focusing on easy visualisation
and data ingestion.
